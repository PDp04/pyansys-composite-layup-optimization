Please don't blindly use the code, do the following:
. In command Prompt do install the required libraries of PyACP and PyMAPDL.
. Make sure that all the 3 files are copied in the directorey, you wanna run.
. While copying it to your directory, please update the address in two places (i.e. ln[1] and ln[18]). 
. at ln[7] the alist will give the list of areas, do choose 4 of them and enter in ln[8] checking whether they ressemble the fillet frame or not then only proceed.
. Do check the direction of Lay-up in ln[26].
. This all has to be done only once, after that the code will carry on all the calculations automatically
